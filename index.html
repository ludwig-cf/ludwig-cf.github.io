<h3> Overview </h3>

<p>
This introduction provides a brief overview of what the <i>Ludwig</i> code
does, how to obtain and build it, and how to run a sample problem.
It is assumed that the reader has at least a general knowledge
of Navier-Stokes hydrodynamics, complex fluids, and to some
extent statistical physics. This knowledge will be required to make sense
of the input and output involved in using the code. Those wanting
to work on or develop the code itself will need knowledge of ANSI C,
and perhaps message passing and CUDA. We assume the reader is using
a Unix-based system.
</p>

<h4>Purpose of the Code</h4>

<p>
The <i>Ludwig</i> code has been developed over a number of
years to address specific problems in complex fluids. The underlying
hydrodynamic model is based on the lattice Boltzmann equation
(LBE, or just `LB'). This itself may be used to study simple
(Newtonian) fluids in a number of different scenarios, including porous
media and particle suspensions. However, the
code is more generally suited to complex fluids, where a number of
options are available, among others: symmetric binary fluids and
Brazovskii smectics,
polar gels, liquid crystals, or charged fluid via a Poisson-Boltzmann
equation approach. These features are added in the framework of a
free energy approach, where specific compositional or orientational
order parameters are evolved according to the appropriate
coarse-grained dynamics, but also interact with the fluid in a
fully coupled fashion.

<h4>How the code works</h4>

We aim to provide a robust and portable code, written in ANSI C, which
can be used to perform serial and scalable parallel simulations of
complex fluid systems based around hydrodynamics via the lattice
Boltzmann method. Time evolution of modelled quantities takes
place on a fixed regular discrete lattice. The preferred method of
dealing with the corresponding order parameter equations is by
using finite difference. However, for the case of a binary fluid,
a two-distribution lattice Boltzmann approach is also maintained
for historical reference.

Users control the operation of the code via a plain text input file;
output for various data are available. These data may be visualised
using appropriate third-party software (e.g., Paraview). Specific
diagnostic output may require alterations to the code.

Potential users should also note that the complex fluid simulations
enabled by \textit{Ludwig} can be time consuming, prone to instability,
and provide results which are difficult to
interpret. We make no apology for this: that's the way it is.
